        <h1>PRETZEL</h1>
        <p>
          A pretzel is a type of baked pastry made from dough that is commonly
          shaped into a knot. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive
          symmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined
          and then twisted back onto itself in a particular way (a pretzel
          loop). In modern times, pretzels come in a wide range of shapes.

          Salt is the most common seasoning for pretzels, complementing the
          washing soda or lye treatment that gives pretzels their traditional
          skin and flavor acquired through the Maillard reaction. Other
          seasonings are cheeses, sugar, chocolate, cinnamon, sweet glazing,
          seeds, and nuts. Varieties of pretzels include soft pretzels, which
          should be eaten shortly after preparation, and hard-baked pretzels,
          which have a long shelf life.
